# EKEEL Documentation

Welcome to the EKEEL documentation repository. This repository uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate and host the documentation for the EKEEL project.

The documentation is available at the [ekeel-project/docs](https://ekeel-project.github.io/docs/) website

## Overview


EKEEL (Empowering Knowledge Extraction to Empower Learners) is a research project funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) under the PRIN 2022 PNRR programme, a nationally managed programme supported through the European Union – Next Generation EU.

The project aims to develop tools and services for knowledge extraction and its application to video augmentation. This repository hosts the official documentation of the EKEEL project, including setup guides, deployment instructions, and technical references to the project components and codebase.

The documentation refreshes every Monday at 4 AM and updates the website content.
